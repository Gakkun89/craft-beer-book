Craft Beer Book Project

Overview:
Build a basic log book of craft beers I have tried with info
about the beers along with images which will be scraped online.

Basic functionality:
- User can add beers by name (searched on beeradvocate.com and scraped)
- Manual entry for beers not on BA
- Scrape will pull in facts and image
- User can list all beers in the book
- Will all be saved to SQL DB
- Will be a basic webapp in Sinatra

Tech:
- Ruby
- Sinatra for web app
- SQL.lite for DB
- Nokogiri for parsing
